In order to operate this system please ensure that You have the following installed :
1) Node.js
2) NPM (installs automatically with Node.js)

For best results test with google chrome as browser environment.
Broweser must support getUserMedia.

Unzip the prototype.zip folder

To install please navigate to "PROTOTYPE" folder in CMD
Run "npm install" ( This will install all dependancies)
Once install is complete after a minute or two run "npm start"
This will start the system on a localhost port.

Once the system is live you must first register an account to use the system.
Or If you would not like to create an account I have created a test account with the credentials :

Email: test123@testmail.com
Password: Test123!!

Once logged in you will encounter the Chord analyser screen.
To begin press "Start Listening"
You will then receive a prompt to allow the system to use your microphone input.
If you do not have access to a guitar I have record examples of chord strums in the "Examples folder"
